## Retrieval Models

This repository involves writing two main programs:

1. A program to parse the corpus and index it with Elasticsearch.
2. A query processor, which runs queries from an input file using a selected retrieval model

Retrieval Models Implemented as a part of Task 2 :
1. Okapi TF
2. TF-IDF
3. Okapi BM25
4. Unigram LM with Laplace smoothing
5. Unigram LM with Jelinek-Mercer smoothing
