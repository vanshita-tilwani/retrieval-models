# Homework 1: Retrieval Models

## Objective
Introduction to Elasticsearch: one of the many available commercial-grade indexes. These instructions will generally not spell out how to accomplish various tasks in Elasticsearch; instead, you are encouraged to read the online documentation to familiarize yourself with this tool. Feel free to ask for help on Piazza or during office hours if you encounter any difficulties.

Implement and compare various retrieval systems using vector space models and language models. Explain how and why their performance differs.

This assignment involves writing two main programs:

1. A program to parse the corpus and index it with Elasticsearch.
2. A query processor, which runs queries from an input file using a selected retrieval model.
